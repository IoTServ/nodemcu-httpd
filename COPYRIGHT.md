httpd.lua contains websocket encode and decode functions simplified from https://github.com/creationix/nodemcu-webide, which is under MIT license. Since i'm not going to try relicensing let's keep all the .lua files in the root as MIT licensed.

www/edit.htm and the example www/index.htm were lifted from https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer, which is i guess under LGPL 2.1 or later, so i'll keep all static code in www as LGPL 2.1 or later.
